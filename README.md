# DO NOT DOWNLOAD TRON

This is not a miracle tool - it is an overhyped monetized scam tool promoted by "Tech admins" on youtube

## What this tool does
- Update windows?
- Use of thirdparty driver installers (Which is a not preferred method as many sysadmins will state)
- Run a malware scan? Just download https://malwarebytes.org



# Verdict 
The owner has no malicious intent with the script itself, however his motives as promoting himself as a messiah in malware remover - is questionable
